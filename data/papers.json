In this talk I will discuss the many dimensions and uses of the social hyperlink across a variety of online communities. Sometimes it is the information that brings the people together, as they are seeking answers to questions, or seeking to answer questions. In online question and answer forums, hyperlinks record a fleeting social interaction, an information exchange. In other instances, for example, in virtual worlds, social hyperlinks may be conduits for social influence, direct transfer of information, or even the sharing of virtual goods. Occasionally, an online tie is established in order to navigate the real world, or more specifically, find a real couch to sleep on.

The second contribution is that we conducted a relatively large-scale experiment, and analysis of our results revealed the characteristics of the problem of finding movedWeb pages. We demonstrated empirically that the problem of searching for moved pages is different from typical information retrieval problems. First, it is impossible to identify the final destination until the page is moved, so the index-server approach is not necessarily effective. Secondly, there is a large bias about where the new address is likely to be and crawler-based solutions can be effectively implemented, avoiding the need to search the entire Web.

The way to achieve that is to provide learners with a meta-cognitive tool that enables them to bring knowledge gained from the Web to the surface and visualize what they have in mind. Once we get the learner's viewpoint externalized, it will be converted to a hypermedia layer that will be laid over the Web pages visited by the learner.

Our solution is based on multifaceted search, which provides an efficient update mechanism for relations between objects, as well as efficient search over the heterogeneous data. We describe a social search engine positioned within a large enterprise, applied over social data gathered from several Web 2.0 applications.

To access and share resources, they add keywords called tags to the resources. As the tags are freely chosen keywords, it might not be possible for users to tag their resources with all the relevant tags. As a result, many resources lack sufficient number of relevant tags. The lack of relevant tags results into sparseness of data, and this sparseness of data makes many relevant resources unsearchable against user queries. In this paper, we explore two dimensions of semantic relationships between tags, based on the context and the distribution of tags. We exploit semantic relationships between tags to reduce sparseness in Folksonomies and propose different enriched vector space models. We also propose a vector space model Best of Breed which utilizes appropriate enrichment method based on the type of the query. We evaluate the proposed methods on a large dataset of 27 million resources, 92 thousand tags and 94 million tag assignments.

But due to the diversity of these applications -- serving different aims -- the Social Web is ironically divided. Blog users who write about music for example, could possibly benefit from other users registered in other social systems operating within the same domain, such as a social radio station. Although these sites are two different and disconnected systems, offering distinct services to the users, the fact that domains are compatible could benefit users from both systems with interesting and multi-faceted information. In this paper we propose to automatically establish social links between distinct social systems through cross-tagging, i.e., enriching a social system with the tags of other similar social system(s).

We build upon prior work by extracting relationships among tags and among resources from two social bookmarking systems, Bibsonomy.org and GiveALink.org. We introduce a scalable and collaborative measure that we name maximum information path (MIP) similarity. Our analysis shows that MIP outperforms the best scalable similarity measures in the literature.

Users of social media sites such as Flickr often face the enormous challenge of which group to choose, due to the presence of numerous competing groups of similar content. Determining an empirical measure of significance of a group can help tackle this problem. The proposed framework therefore determines an optimal measure per group based on past user participation and interaction as well as likely future activity in the group. The framework is tested on a Flickr dataset and the results show that this method can yield satisfactory predictions of group activity.

To support that, a general framework for an authoring tool is proposed through two main phases. During the first phase, an automatic and parameterized transformation is applied on the input activity trace to generate a fragmented document. Each fragment describes one or many observed elements of the modeled trace and relations between fragments are deduced from relations between these elements.
